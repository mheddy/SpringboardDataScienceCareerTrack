# Mode Analytics Case Study

## Investigating a Drop in User Engagement

### The problem

You show up to work Tuesday morning, September 2, 2014. The head of the Product team walks over to your desk and asks you what you think about the latest activity on the user engagement dashboards. You fire them up, and something immediately jumps out:  
![Weekly-Active-Users](https://github.com/mheddy/SpringboardDataScienceCareerTrack/blob/master/DataWrangling/SQL/charts/Weekly-Active-Users.png)  
The above chart shows the number of engaged users each week. Yammer defines engagement as having made some type of server call by interacting with the product (shown in the data as events of type “engagement”). Any point in this chart can be interpreted as “the number of users who logged at least one engagement event during the week starting on that date.”

You are responsible for determining what caused the dip at the end of the chart shown above and, if appropriate, recommending solutions for the problem.

### Digging in

Once you have an ordered list of possible problems, it’s time to investigate.

For this problem, you will need to use four tables. The tables names and column definitions are listed below—click a table name to view information about that table. Note: this data is fake and was generated for the purpose of this case study. It is similar in structure to Yammer’s actual data, but for privacy and security reasons it is not real.

* __Table 1: Users__
* __Table 2: Events__
* __Table 3: Email Events__
* __Table 4: Rollup Periods__

### Making a recommendation

Start to work your way through your list of hypotheses in order to determine the source of the drop in engagement. As you explore, make sure to save your work. It may be helpful to start with the code that produces the above query, which you can find by clicking the link in the footer of the chart and navigating to the “query” tab.

Answer the following questions:

* Do the answers to any of your original hypotheses lead you to further questions?
* If so, what are they and how will you test them?
* If they are questions that you can’t answer using data alone, how would you go about answering them (hypothetically, assuming you actually worked at this company)?
* What seems like the most likely cause of the engagement dip?
* What, if anything, should the company do in response?

## Solution

### Possible problems

**Broken feature**:   
It is possible that something in the application is broken, and therefore impossible for people to use. 

**Broken tracking code**:   
It’s possible that the code that logs events is, itself, broken. 

**Search crawler changes**:   
For a website that receives a lot of traffic, changes in the way search engines index them could cause big swings in traffic.

### Solving the case
#### 1. Check growth
```
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',created_at) AS day,
       COUNT(*) AS all_users,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN activated_at IS NOT NULL THEN u.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS activated_users
  FROM tutorial.yammer_users u
 WHERE created_at >= '2014-06-01'
   AND created_at < '2014-09-01'
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 1
```
![Daily_Signups](https://github.com/mheddy/SpringboardDataScienceCareerTrack/blob/master/DataWrangling/SQL/charts/Daily_Signups.png)  
From above chart, we can see that growth is normal. 

#### 2. Check device 
```
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', occurred_at) AS week,
       COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) AS weekly_active_users,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN e.device IN ('macbook pro','lenovo thinkpad','macbook air','dell inspiron notebook',
          'asus chromebook','dell inspiron desktop','acer aspire notebook','hp pavilion desktop','acer aspire desktop','mac mini')
          THEN e.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS computer,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN e.device IN ('iphone 5','samsung galaxy s4','nexus 5','iphone 5s','iphone 4s','nokia lumia 635',
       'htc one','samsung galaxy note','amazon fire phone') THEN e.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS phone,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN e.device IN ('ipad air','nexus 7','ipad mini','nexus 10','kindle fire','windows surface',
        'samsumg galaxy tablet') THEN e.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS tablet
  FROM tutorial.yammer_events e
 WHERE e.event_type = 'engagement'
   AND e.event_name = 'login'
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 1
```
![Engagement_by_Device](https://github.com/mheddy/SpringboardDataScienceCareerTrack/blob/master/DataWrangling/SQL/charts/Weekly_Engagement_by_Device.png)  
From above chart, we can see that there’s a pretty steep drop in phone engagement rates. So it’s likely that there’s a problem with the mobile app related to long-time user retention. 

#### 3. Check emails
```
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', occurred_at) AS week,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN e.action = 'sent_weekly_digest' THEN e.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS weekly_emails,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN e.action = 'sent_reengagement_email' THEN e.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS reengagement_emails,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN e.action = 'email_open' THEN e.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS email_opens,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN e.action = 'email_clickthrough' THEN e.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS email_clickthroughs
  FROM tutorial.yammer_emails e
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 1
 ```
 ![Email_Actions](https://github.com/mheddy/SpringboardDataScienceCareerTrack/blob/master/DataWrangling/SQL/charts/Email_Actions.png) 
We can see see that clickthroughs are way down. 
 
#### 4. Check email clickthroughs
```
SELECT week,
       weekly_opens/CASE WHEN weekly_emails = 0 THEN 1 ELSE weekly_emails END::FLOAT AS weekly_open_rate,
       weekly_ctr/CASE WHEN weekly_opens = 0 THEN 1 ELSE weekly_opens END::FLOAT AS weekly_ctr,
       retain_opens/CASE WHEN retain_emails = 0 THEN 1 ELSE retain_emails END::FLOAT AS retain_open_rate,
       retain_ctr/CASE WHEN retain_opens = 0 THEN 1 ELSE retain_opens END::FLOAT AS retain_ctr
  FROM (
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week',e1.occurred_at) AS week,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN e1.action = 'sent_weekly_digest' THEN e1.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS weekly_emails,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN e1.action = 'sent_weekly_digest' THEN e2.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS weekly_opens,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN e1.action = 'sent_weekly_digest' THEN e3.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS weekly_ctr,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN e1.action = 'sent_reengagement_email' THEN e1.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS retain_emails,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN e1.action = 'sent_reengagement_email' THEN e2.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS retain_opens,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN e1.action = 'sent_reengagement_email' THEN e3.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS retain_ctr
  FROM tutorial.yammer_emails e1
  LEFT JOIN tutorial.yammer_emails e2
    ON e2.occurred_at >= e1.occurred_at
   AND e2.occurred_at < e1.occurred_at + INTERVAL '5 MINUTE'
   AND e2.user_id = e1.user_id
   AND e2.action = 'email_open'
  LEFT JOIN tutorial.yammer_emails e3
    ON e3.occurred_at >= e2.occurred_at
   AND e3.occurred_at < e2.occurred_at + INTERVAL '5 MINUTE'
   AND e3.user_id = e2.user_id
   AND e3.action = 'email_clickthrough'
 WHERE e1.occurred_at >= '2014-06-01'
   AND e1.occurred_at < '2014-09-01'
   AND e1.action IN ('sent_weekly_digest','sent_reengagement_email')
 GROUP BY 1
       ) a
 ORDER BY 1
```
![Open_CT_Rates](https://github.com/mheddy/SpringboardDataScienceCareerTrack/blob/master/DataWrangling/SQL/charts/Open_CT_Rates.png)  
This chart shows in greater detail clickthrough and open rates of emails, indicating clearly that the problem has to do with digest emails in addition to mobile apps.

### Answers to the questions
After investigation, it appears that the problem has to do with mobile use and digest emails. The company should check these areas to make sure something isn’t broken or poorly implemented.
